# Campground-Explorer
This project was done in an attempt to learn the full stack development of a web application. Folks with a passion in travelling can use this web application to upload their experiences of particular campgrounds and review other uploaded experiences. The frontend of this application was implemented using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and backend with MongoDB as the database. To integrate frontend with the backend NodeJS and ExpressJS frameworks were used. The general alogrithms were implemented in javascript.
